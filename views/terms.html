                            conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible
                            for the products and services provided by such third parties. Some membership plans may have
                            differing conditions and limitations,which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other
                            communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your Netflix

                <ol>
                    <p>We may from time to time offer special promotional offers, plans or memberships (“Offers”). Offer
                        eligibility is determined by Netflix at its sole discretion and we reserve the right to revoke

                <li><b>Billing and Cancellation</b></li>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Billing Cycle:</b> The membership fee for the Netflix service and any other charges you may
                        incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees,
                        will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the "Account"
                        page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose
                        when you signed up for the service. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if
                        your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if
                        your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit the netflix.com
                        website and click on the "Billing details" link on the "Account" page to see your next payment
                        date. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related
                        charges through various methods, including authorizing it for up to approximately one month of
                        service as soon as you register. If you signed up for Netflix using your account with a third
                        party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your Netflix membership by
                        visiting your account with the applicable third party.</li>

                    <li><b>Payment Methods:</b> To use the Netflix service you must provide one or more Payment Methods.
                        You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary
                        Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee.
                        You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled,
                        due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may
                        suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method.
                        For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction
                        fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary
                        depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for
                        details.</li>

                    <li><b>Updating your Payment Methods:</b> You can update your Payment Methods by going to the
                        "Account" page. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the
                        payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the
                        applicable Payment Method(s).</li>

                    <li><b>Cancellation:</b> You can cancel your Netflix membership at any time, and you will continue
                        to have access to the Netflix service through the end of your billing period. To the extent
                        permitted by the applicable law, payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or
                        credits for any partial membership periods or unused Netflix content. To cancel, go to the
                        "Account" page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your
                        account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your
                        account will close, click "Billing details" on the "Account" page. If you signed up for Netflix
                        using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your Netflix
                        membership, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account
                        with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the Netflix
                        service through that third party</li>

                    <li><b>Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans:</b>We may change our subscription plans and the
                        price of our service from time to time; however, any price changes or changes to your
                        subscription plans will apply no earlier than 30 days following notice to you.</li>
                </ol>

                <li><b>Passwords and Account Access</b></li>
                <ol>
                    <p>You are responsible for any activity that occurs through the Netflix account. By allowing others
                        to access the account (which includes access to information on viewing activity for the
                        account), you agree that such individuals are acting on your behalf and that you are bound by
                        any changes that they may make to the account, including but not limited to changes to the
                        subscription plan. To help maintain control over the account and to prevent any unauthorized
                        users from accessing the account, you should maintain control over the devices that are used to
                        access the service and not reveal the password or details of the Payment Method associated with
                        the account to anyone. You agree to provide and maintain accurate information relating to your
                        account, including a valid email address so we can send you account related notices. We can
                        terminate your account or place your account on hold in order to protect you, Netflix or our
                        partners from identity theft or other fraudulent activity.</p>
                </ol>
